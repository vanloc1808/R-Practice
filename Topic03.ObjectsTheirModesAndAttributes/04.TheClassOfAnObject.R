#all objects in R have a class, reported by the function class
#allow for an object-oriented style of programming in R
#for example, if an object has class "data.frame", it will be printed in a certain way,
#the plot() function will display it graphically in a certain way,
#other so-called generic functions such as summary() will react to it as an argument in a way sensitive to its class
